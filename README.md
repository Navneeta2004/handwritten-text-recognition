# Handwritten Text Recognition with Transformer OCR

This Python script leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) using the TrOCR (Transformer Optical Character Recognition) model for recognizing handwritten text. It captures images from the camera of an Android device, processes them, and extracts the text from the images.

The model used is the Microsoft TrOCR, which is still under development and currently only supports recognizing a single line of text.

The input is obtained from the mobile camera via the IP Webcam app.

Future goal:
Enhancing the model's accuracy through further training and developing an application capable of reliably recognizing handwritten text.
